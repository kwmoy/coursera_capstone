If you cannot think of an idea or a problem, here are some ideas to get you started:_\n",

    "_In Module 3, we explored New York City and the city of Toronto and segmented and clustered their neighborhoods. Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. One interesting idea would be to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. Is New York City more like Toronto or Paris or some other multicultural city? I will leave it to you to refine this idea._\n",

    "After school programs are thought to improve outcomes for at-risk students, however the effects as documented have been questionable for after school programs in general. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4597889/\">One meta analysis housed in an NIH library</a> documents the generalized, questionable results. __The client, the YMCA of Greater Toronto, has requested an upcoming Data Scientist, Kevin Moy, to identify an area within the City of Toronto to test a novel youth development center and program. The client identified that this area must be a high-risk area, with access to a large density of at-risk students. If this effort is found to be successful, the program will be expanded to other YMCA of Greater Toronto locations.__\n",

    "Furthermore, their <a href=\"https://www.ymca.net/about-us/\">About Us Page</a> describes how the organization aims to bridge the gaps in community needs, further identifying that \"We believe everyone should have the opportunity to learn, grow, and thrive.\" This project serves as a cornerstone project in their mission and business purpose, proving that they are the organization that unequivocally delivers change, contrary to the so-so results from the NIH Library meta analysis."
