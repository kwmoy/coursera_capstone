Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries.

Is New York City more like Toronto or Paris or some other multicultural city? I will leave it to you to refine this idea._\n",

    "After school programs are thought to improve outcomes for at-risk students, however the effects as documented have been questionable for after school programs in general. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4597889/\">One meta analysis housed in an NIH library</a> documents the generalized, questionable results. __The client, the YMCA of Greater Toronto, has requested an upcoming Data Scientist, Kevin Moy, to identify an area within the City of Toronto to test a novel youth development center and program. The client identified that this area must be a high-risk area, with access to a large density of at-risk students. If this effort is found to be successful, the program will be expanded to other YMCA of Greater Toronto locations.__\n",

    "\n",
    "Some observations were included within the data section, for clarity. We observed that, in the section __Are there standout crime-ridden locations in Toronto that we need to immediately address? (part ii):__, that there were indeed seven outlier neighborhoods that seemed to need additional investigation. These outliers on the boxplot were at least two standard deviations above the mean. These neighborhoods would be the ones to look for in our analysis, as we considered other factors.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the table found in section 5.2 of this report, we saw cluster 4 had no community centers, yet had low-average crime. This was an exception that we WOULD expect due to the NIH study previously cited. Future studies may look at reasons why these neighborhoods maintain low-average crime to lower future crime levels in other high-crime neighborhoods.\n",

Most importantly, high crime rates. In the analysis of clusters, we discovered that cluster 1 was the best match for our intentions. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Explanation of Choice:__ Humber Summit can benefit from this effort, as it has a 4.63 crime score, and 0 Community Centers from within 1 km from neighborhood center. However, Humber Summit has a low population density (-1 when normalized), but is still sizable for the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Alternate YMCA Project Locations:__ A future project is the \"University\" neighborhood, in cluster 1. It has no community centers, and a crime score of 2.35. Its population density is middle-of-the-road, and it is bordered by \"Bay Street Corridor\", also in cluster 1, and \"Kensington Chinatown\", in cluster 2. These two neighborhoods also have above average crime scores, and only one community center within 1 km of neighborhood center. This means that a community center in the University neighborhood may attract the youth from those two neighborhoods as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Considerations for Expansion of Study:__ The team believes the results can be expanded to other clusters within Canada and the United States. However, cultural differences will need to be considered for applicability in other countries. Additionally, the initial pilot study involving this novel YMCA program should be tested prior to expansion and expenditure of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Limitations:__ This simple study is limited by a few factors:\n",
    "    1. No gauge for youth-only population: Future studies should utilize census sources to confirm youth populations in recommended areas.\n",
    "    2. Prevention of Crime: Other factors should be investigated for preventing crime. Cluster 5 should be investigated for factors that may contribute to low crime in an area with very sparse community centers. Socioeconomic factors need to be included in that study, in case those are merely upscale neighborhoods."
